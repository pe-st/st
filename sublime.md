Sublime Text
============

## Plugins

Managed by Package Control

### Markdown

- Default Markdown Syntax doesn't support Github Flavored Markdown
- MarkdownEditing is better than knockdown

### Advanced New File

- Bound to <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>N</kbd> (as opposed to <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>N</kbd>)
- Let's define a name (with a smart default path) before editing
