Sublime Text
============

## Plugins

- Managed by Package Control
- Listed in alphabetic order


### Advanced New File

- Bound to <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>N</kbd> (as opposed to <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>N</kbd>)
- Let's define a name (with a smart default path) before editing


### GitGutter

- Seems to slow down ST (at least on Windows?)


### Indent XML

Uses <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>F</kbd>


### MarkdownEditing

- Default Markdown Syntax doesn't support Github Flavored Markdown
- MarkdownEditing is better than knockdown

### Markdown Preview

- Use it with Command Palette
- Github Parser doesn't work through proxy


## Exploration needed

Indent/format code?
Snippets
Projects?
Build System or Command line...?
