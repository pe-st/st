Sublime Text
============

## Plugins

Managed by Package Control

### Markdown

- Default Markdown Syntax doesn't support Github Flavored Markdown
- MarkdownEditing is better than knockdown

- Markdown preview?

### Advanced New File

- Bound to <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>N</kbd> (as opposed to <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>N</kbd>)
- Let's define a name (with a smart default path) before editing

## Exploration needed

Indent/format code?
Snippets
Projects?
Build System or Command line...?
