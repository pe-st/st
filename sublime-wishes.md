# Wishes

## Open new file followed by close

Active buffer should be returned to original buffer, not the one left of the closed one

## Del with Select_lines (ctrl-Shift-up) should behave as Shift-Tab

Now it deletes empty lines, which is not intuitive

## Double-click work selection behaviour sometimes erratic

## Disable column mode with something else than Esc

Esc already used for closing find pane and build pane

## Autocompletion not automatically (or not already for the first character)

## Search in build result pane
